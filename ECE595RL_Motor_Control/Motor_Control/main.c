/**

 * @brief Main source code for the Motor Control program.
 *
 * This file contains the main entry point and function definitions for the Motor Control program.
 *
 * SysTick is used to check if a collision has been detected and toggles the LEDs on the chassis board.
 *
 * It also uses Timer A0 to generate PWM signals which will be used to drive the DC motors.
 * Then, it uses edge-triggered interrupts from the bumper switches to detect a collision.
 * After a collision has been detected, the motors should stop from running.
 *
 * In addition, Timer A2 is used to generate PWM signals and drive two HS-485HB servos.
